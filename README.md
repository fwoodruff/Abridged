# Abridged

At work we have been taking turns to give evening quizzes as a short team-motivating break.
For one of the quizzes, you are given the definition of a word. An 'A' is prepended. You are then given the definition of this new word and you need to find its definition.
For example:

"The word means 'made a crossing.' Add an 'A', the word means 'modified.'"

Answer: "bridged, abridged."

I have made a list of words that have this property and can be used in our quiz.

# Word towers
We then had another game where we were given a definition or clue for a nine letter word.
One letter was removed to give an eight letter word.
We were then given a definition for the eight letter word. Another letter was removed and so on.

The goal was to find all 9 words.
For example:

"The nine letter word means 'shocking';
the eight letter word is a kind of bird;
seven: 'to look intensely'.
six: can be tied into a knot;
five: to pierce and wound;
four: make a pleasant sound;
three: evil;
two: enclosed; one: the definite pronoun."

Answer:
* startling
* starling
* staring
* string
* sting
* sing
* sin
* in
* I

I have found all possible such English 'word towers' from which definitions or clues can be made.
Perhaps surprisingly, there are only 14 nine letter words with the property that it can be made into a tower.
Many of these nine letter words have a number of routes to one.

This project took an evening.
